bombermanjs
===========

This is a node.js TCP client for [aybabtme's bomberman](https://github.com/aybabtme/bomberman/) game.
You can use `exampleAi.js` as a starting point for your AI.

Version
=======
This was made with node v0.8.16. The socket API might have changed since then. If you're using a different version of node and the client doesn't work the first thing to check is what node version you're on. You can open an issue/send a pull request to update it for new node.
